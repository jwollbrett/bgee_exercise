## Part_of metrics
Using part_of property (and subproperties) we found 258 ancestors of homology annotations. 66 of them contained variations (~25%).
* Mainly found cluster of species for the same homology entity : 
   * Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus
   * Danio, Xenopus, Drosophila melanogaster
* Over represented species : Danio, Xenopus (~50%)
* Rarely represented species : C. elegans

## Develop_from metrics
Using developed_from property (and subproperties) we found 419 ancestors for homology annotations. 60 of them contained variations (~14%).
* Over represented species : Danio, Xenopus, Homo sapiens (~90%)
* Rarely represented species : Mus musculus, Gallus, Drosophila melanogaster

## Results
In the result files we can distinginsh 3 different kind of homologous structures having ancestors through object properties (or any of its subproperties) that vary between species :
* homologous structures having different ancestors through properties and coming from species outside of the homology
* homologous structures having different ancestors through properties from species inside of the homology but with ancestors coming from the same subpart of the ontology
* homologous structures having different ancestors through properties from species inside of the homology but with ancestors coming from different subpart of the ontology.

### 1. Ancestors associated to species outside of the homology


### 2. Ancestors associated to same subpart of the ontology
These results are the more abundant in the result file but don't seem very interesting as they can be caused by annotation precision
Example : 

### 3. Ancestors coming from different subpart of the ontology

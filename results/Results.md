## Results
In the result files we can distinginsh 3 different kind of homologous structures having ancestors through object properties (or any of its subproperties) that vary between species :
* homologous structures having different ancestors through properties and coming from species outside of the homology
* homologous structures having different ancestors through properties from species inside of the homology but with ancestors coming from the same subpart of the ontology
* homologous structures having different ancestors through properties from species inside of the homology but with ancestors coming from different subpart of the ontology.

## Ancestors coming from species outside of the homology


## Ancestors coming from same subpart of the ontology
These results are the more abundant in the result file but don't seem very interesting as they can be caused by annotation precision
Example : 

## Ancestors coming from different subpart of the ontology
